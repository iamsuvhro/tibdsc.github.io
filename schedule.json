And told that in addition to the usual complexities (logic, databases, testing), you also need to deliver on a rich user experience that involves custom animations? I have.\r\n\r\nAnd what if I told you it’s not just possible, it’s fun -- and it doesn’t take three months. You can do it in two. And, by taking advantage of the built-in Firebase integration, you can take advantage of rich services for authentication, storage, databases and machine learning.\r\n\r\nWelcome to Flutter. A new open-source mobile SDK from Google that allows you to “build beautiful native apps in record time” -- and deliver unique apps for Android and iOS from a single codebase written in Dart. ",

One of the ingredients that allowed them this success is the effective use of Cyclical Learning Rates in their models. CLR is not a well-studied topic and it is still not accepted by the community because it was proposed by an organization which is not that much in the AI limelight. But CLR has shown some exceptional results in the training of Neural Nets. ",

One of the ingredients that allowed them this success is the effective use of Cyclical Learning Rates in their models. CLR is not a well-studied topic and it is still not accepted by the community because it was proposed by an organization which is not that much in the AI limelight. But CLR has shown some exceptional results in the training of Neural Nets. ",

And told that in addition to the usual complexities (logic, databases, testing), you also need to deliver on a rich user experience that involves custom animations? I have.\r\n\r\nAnd what if I told you it’s not just possible, it’s fun -- and it doesn’t take three months. You can do it in two. And, by taking advantage of the built-in Firebase integration, you can take advantage of rich services for authentication, storage, databases and machine learning.\r\n\r\nWelcome to Flutter. A new open-source mobile SDK from Google that allows you to “build beautiful native apps in record time” -- and deliver unique apps for Android and iOS from a single codebase written in Dart. ",
